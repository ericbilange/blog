# How to Innovate?

I have always felt that innovating in large organiations is difficult. And it is...

Large corporations have to rely on layers of management in order to scale (or split into a myriad of small entities like Google became Alphabet). Such a model can fail for many reasons, but some are more important than others:

_Culture is of prime importance_

 middle managers may be focused on the position and not the job itself which means that they don’t want to bring bad news to upper management being scared of losing their position. If this type of culture trickles down the chain of command, the top is completely disconnected from market realities and this has disastrous implications to the company. Another side effect is to create silos: a department has a budget, its own resources and has to do with it. With this boxing approach, company-wide knowledge, lessons learnt, resources are not shared and leveraged: each division/department may repeat mistakes of others, scale is reduced, and even the company brand can be tarnished. 3M has developed a culture of collaboration (cross-division) and openness with simple mechanisms: no fear to fail as long as you fail fast (so it’s not too expensive); iterate and learn your lessons; bring team members from all divisions in all aspects (not just R&D) to help you compensate your weaknesses or lack of knowledge/experience. 

_Innovation_

 to stay relevant, a company and its products have to evolve. Especially nowadays as most technologies can evolve quickly; many successful disruptions have developed an appetite for more to come. No company can sit on its legacy (not even Coke with their ‘formula’). To stay relevant, a company has to encourage innovation to improve its products and create new ones. 3M’s 15%-rule of time given to employees to “create and innovate” is a good approach and is also supported by cross-company events such as seminars, awards, etc. to reward innovation and share knowledge.

_Process and goals_

 without clear processes and goals, a company is destined to drifting. A company must not lose sight of going after sales and profit objectives on identified markets. This seems like an opposing force to innovation and openness but when objectives are well explained and endorsed by every employee, these two forces help each other. 3M for example is capable of iterating on prototypes, launching new products and sunsetting products frequently with a discipline of learning lessons from the market (e.g., pricing, customer feedback, geographies, etc. the 4P). So, failing is not bad at 3M, failing without understanding why however is wrong. Continuing on an unsuccessful line of product is not bad as long as there is a learning behind, product adjustment in line with market asks and a realistic business plan.

Entrepreneurs can get things done: they can move things from A to B. They have the right mix of passion, knowledge, goals and execution.  A company that wishes to have entrepreneurs (or intra-preneurs) has to create the proper environment to welcome them and grow them. Companies like 3M or Google (which shows some similarities) are good models of applying these principles.
