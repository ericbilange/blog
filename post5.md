# Reverse Due Diligence

Behind this title, I mean to get ready for a due diligence. So, this is the time, your company is ready for a serious milestone: an exit, a new round of funding or even your first round of funding. You know that it will take time to pitch your company and you also know that the last miles will be all about its valuation. I have never seen a due dilligences fail because of the technology of a company but believe me, I have seen many company losing loads of points for not being able to present their assets the best way!

This post is a quick high level list of things to do with such event, and if you want I can help you to get ready!

1. Data room

It all starts with posting a lot of documents in the data room: your future backer will get to know the details of your company first accessing all docs you will publish there. Many sections/directories: from sales to support and operations. The tech and product team of the due diligence crew will obviously focus on all technical documentations but will also have a look at product-related sources: product management, support (yes, looking at customer tickets and some KPIs is always revealing), marketing collaterals describing your products, customizations, and very likley sales pipelines. 
How do you want to present yourself? Neat, trimmed, groomed or all over the place with a bunch of documents with various styles, headers, footers, no history, etc.? Think about being tight more than large and spread out. Volume is irrelevant and inconsistencies will reflect poorly on you.

2. Sanitize

Other than the data room, your services, code, databases, etc. should all be sanitized. A few perspectives:
- licenses: are you current? You won't believe how many companies are in breach with server licenses... yikes!
- open source: are you in line with the usage license of all the open source software you are using? Prove it!
- security: when is the last time you performed a white hack test? 
- back-ups: when is the last time you restored an existing back-up?
- kpis, dashboards
- code reviews...
- etc.

Most of that should be in your operation plans/playbook. If not, well you know what you have to do and you know what you have to perform!

3. Products and architectures

You will have to present your products to a due diligence team that probably don't know you very well, and even worse, may not know the industry or your positioning. When you give your presentations, make sure you don't assume anything and certainly no prior knowledge of the industry or your company. Even if you have experts in front of you, it's always advisable to share your assumptions and vision of the "context" and "landcsape" when you present your products. 

For sure your products are of interest - otherwise you won't be under a due dilliegence - but when you present them, you have to bear in mind what the team in front of you also has in mind:

- are there any smells?
- what are the weaknesses, strengths?
- can things be copied?
- can things be done in a better way?
- what is the technical debt?
- what are the anticipated pains in the future: their type, their costs
- can you scale? can you keep the same competitive positioning, or improve?
- can you attract talented people because your shine like a Sun?

So pay attention to these details when you present your products, architectures and code... Make sure you also have
- proper processes
- proper governances
- proper practices

Security, ethics, privacy, replicability, scale, quality are all aspects you are aware of, but not necessirily excel in all of them. There is nothing wrong with that as long as you are concious of it and you have a "plan" to address them.

4. The team

Maybe not everyone in your team is familiar with a due diligence process. It's a good time to educate, explain and somehow prepare your team for it. Not so much that you want them to say things that are not true, it's more how to say things or simply how to say "I don't know".
Your team is great - again, otherwise you won't be here with a due diligence - so make sure it shines! 
Your team is great but like any team it is perfectible. Have you thought of trainings? Missing skills? Special activities to improve on innovation, quality, etc. If not, now is a good time to come up with a plan. Your team must be better in the years to come!

Think about your top layer, yourself as well. You and they will be asked the question if they will stay or not, if they are motivated or not. Better be ready (and there is no right or wrong answer)

5. The efficiencies

Unless you are a small startup where everyone is a jack of all trades, passed a certain size, you will have to consider some efficiencies. The question will be on the table no matter what, so you better be redy for it. 
No, it does not mean that you are going to send pink slips the day after the exit. It's more about how you see the organization evolve over a year or two to be better. It may be the scale and hire more people, but you will have to think hard about getting an efficient company/organization. Some topics or ideas to think about: off-shoring, geographic rationalization, outsourcing, partnering, etc. 

If you need any help, I've seen super messy to very clean... I can share experience and help you get ready! Drop me a note.
