# Should we be scared of AI?

The ongoing debate is interesting; much has been said: just google for ["should we be scared of AI"](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=ZORmXN-fBKiwgwfZ1ZqQAw&q=should+we+be+scare+of+ai&oq=sho&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.35i39l2j0i67l8.2258.2661..4057...0.0..0.148.388.2j2......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0j0i131.2q16i3BMB_Q) and you will get close to 50 million hits. Top ones are coming from reputable insitutions and magazines. And with all the "experts" involved, the unanimous answer is "no". That's great news!



__ahem, why this post?__

Well, ok, all experts in the field of AI point back to the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) and say: our AIs (and robots, and self-driving cars, and ...) do not have a "concious" and have a total inabiity to think about how it thinks (wink to my preferred teacher at school, Pr. J. Pitrat who probably said "meta rule" twice per minute during his fascinating lectures). And this is pretty much the essence of the answer to the question: because of this limitation, we should not be scared. 

But, there is more to it! Two things:

1. Can AI generate chaos?
2. Are we sure?

__Can AI generate chaos?__

Elon Musk was recently criticized by his statement that we should regulate AI before it becomes a danger to humanity (cf. [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/17/15980954/elon-musk-ai-regulation-existential-threat)). 
He certainly knows a lot about self-driving cars, remotely controlled cars, etc. with his Tesla experience (wasn't that scary that remotely Tesla extended the battery life of cars on the East Coast during a storm?). Imagine drones (well, you know this exist) delivering parcels. What if one of them runs into someone on the street? WHo is responsible? Imagine autonomous-cops? Yes, this is sci-fi, but definitely coming in some ways: most of mundane tasks are automatizable by AI and robot technologies. They are in contained wharehouses today, in the street tomorrow. 

I cannot agree more with Elon's ask. At least we have to think about it and do something before my neighbor launches a robot on the street with some bugs...

__Are we sure?__

This is what irritates me the most when I read "experts" on the subject. Centuries ago, we had no idea what DNA was, what genetic manipulation was. When the train was invented, doctors said that travelling faster than 80 kmh was dangerous. Up until recently, we had no idea how our senses truly worked (and we still have to discover on the topic). Are we sure that we are not in theese fallacies that AI will never have a concious? I sustect we are blindfolded by our present knowledge and inability to admit that we may understand more than what we know today.

AI and senses can co-exist and leverage each other.
